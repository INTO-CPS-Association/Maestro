initialization mode
----------------------

initialize using InitialUnknowns!?

use extra equations not available in step mode. Set steady state.

# functions

0: fmi2SetXXX for initial=<excat> or initial=<approx>
1: fmi2EnterInitializationMode
1.0: fmi2SetXXX initial=<excat> or
				(causality = <parameter> /*independent?*/) or
				(states at t=0 with initial=<excat> /*I guess that there we be none*/)
1.1: fmi2SetXXX (causality=<input> and (variability=<continuous> or variability=<discrete>)) 
1.2: fmi2SetRealInputDerivatives causality=<input> and variability=<continuous>
1.3 fmi2GetXXX for SV recorded in initial unknown
1.4 fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative for SV recorded in initial unknown and variability=<continuous>
2: fmi2ExitInitializationMode


step mode
------------

set inputs
	inputs + for <continuous> the derivatives
	P_tune
	
do step

get outputs
	outputs + for <continuous> the derivatives
	observable variables? maybe this is <local>
	calculated varying parameters + directional derivatives (<continuous>)
	
# functions (looping)

1: fmi2SetXXX causality = <parameter> and variability = <tunable> or
						(causality=<input> and (variability=<continuous> or variability=<discrete>)) 
2: fmi2SetRealInputDerivatives causality=<input> and variability=<continuous>
3: fmi2DoStep
4: fmi2GetXXX causality : {<continuous>,<discrete>, <local>,<calculatedParameter>} --maybe
5: fmi2GetRealOutputDerivatives causality = <continuous> and variability = <output> --maybe
6: fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative variability: {<continuous>,<discrete>} and type : Real and -- well I dont know for which SV this must be called
