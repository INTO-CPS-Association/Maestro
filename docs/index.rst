INTO-CPS Maestro2
==================

Maestro2 is a Co-simulation Orchestration Engine based on The Functional Mockup Interface 2.0 for Co-simulation.
It consists of a domain specific language (DSL) called Maestro Base Language (MaBL), an interpreter of the language and utilities to assist in designing co-simulations in MaBL.

It is cross-platform as it is based on the JVM and offers interaction through a web interface and a command line interface. 
Furthermore, Maestro 2 has a companion application in the INTO-CPS Application, which offers a graphical user interface and 
utilises the web interface of Maestro 2. This documentation concerns Maestro 2 and not the INTO-CPS Application. 
For more information on the INTO-CPS Application, please see `<https://into-cps-association.github.io/simulation/app.html>`_.
